This is to test using git with latex and chekcing version controll. 
I am using this as test document. 

Let us first start with equation. I will write most famous equation of physics, that is $E=mc^2$. This is called inline equation. Now display equation with number. 

\begin{equation}
E=\sqrt{P^2c^2+m_0^2c^4}
\end{equation}

and now display equation without numbering. 

\[
\div[2]{x}{t}=x*t
\]
